												<h3>Fiscal Policy</h3>

										<h2>Unemployment</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Petoria boasts a 4.6% unemployment rate, between the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Cameroon. Many of our jobs are government jobs. <br />Since we are a fairly new country, only existing for a few decades, many of the jobs we offer are government jobs. <br /><br />Our government jobs range from road work to state-mandated cocoa bean farms.</p>

										<h2>The Business Cycle of Petoria</h2>

									<p>The Business cycle of Petoria is very similiar to the United States. Our main business adventures are in farming and tourism. With advances in farming equipment, our economy is booming. Tourism opens the doors for many small shops for our citizens to open.</p>
